RUN 3 INSTRUCTIONS
There’s a whole new galaxy waiting to be explored! Use the arrow keys to run and jump through the space tunnels. Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the world as you go. 

There are two ways you can play Run 3: Explore Mode and Infinite Mode. To add more levels to your Galaxy Map, choose Explore Mode. The Runner will encounter lots of new tunnels and areas, and may bump into some friends along the way! 

For an endless run, choose Infinite Mode. You’ll find power cells scattered across the tunnels in this mode. You’ll have to watch your step though! If you fall out of the tunnel in Infinite Mode, it’s game over. You can use power cells to continue your run with a new character.

RUN 3 TIPS & TRICKS
New aliens, new tricks. There are 9 characters you can unlock as you play through the levels. If you save up enough power cells, you can unlock new characters right away! Each alien has their own set of skills that will help you navigate the galaxy. If you find yourself stuck in a tricky tunnel, try swapping out your character for a new one. For example, the Skater will perform better in the snow levels!

Control your jumps. The longer you hold down the up arrow key, the higher and longer you’ll jump. For platforms with a small gap in between, try tapping the up arrow to make a small jump. This technique can help you avoid over shooting your landing. 

Look ahead. Put your focus on the platforms just ahead of your character. Take note of all different sides of the tunnel to plan your next jumps. This should help you determine which way to turn the tunnels so that your character has plenty of space to run. 

Infinite practice. Infinite Mode is great for collecting power cells to unlock characters, but it can also be great for practice too! If you’re stuck on a level on the galaxy map, try a few runs through the infinite tunnels. The tunnels won’t be the same every time, so you’ll get a good feel for the different obstacles.
